## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Two-stage parameter extraction with solution-format structure**: Implemented chain-of-thought reasoning for grid parameter selection. Stage 1 extracts explicit problem structure using `ProblemStructureExtractor` in the same format as test problem solutions (search_space, objective, budget, batch_size, noise_model, constraints). Stage 2 uses this structured representation to make grid selections via enhanced `ParameterExtractor`. This approach ensures consistency with validation expectations and improves accuracy through explicit reasoning.
- **Solution-format Pydantic models**: Added `SearchSpaceParameter`, `ObjectiveSpec`, `ConstraintSpec`, and `ProblemStructure` models that mirror the solution structure from test problems, ensuring perfect alignment between extraction and validation.
- **Enhanced debug output**: Parameter selector now shows both Stage 1 (problem structure in solution format) and Stage 2 (grid selections) with clear formatting for better transparency and debugging.
- **Detailed grid selection rules**: Enhanced prompt includes explicit lookup table mapping extracted structure to grid parameters with special emphasis on constraint type distinctions.
- **Problem statement collection**: Created `data/raw/problem_statements.yaml` with initial problem statement for ceramic sintering optimization. Includes natural version (underspecified), corrected version (conversational with density units), Honegumi-specific grid selections (objective, model, task, constraints), links to relevant Honegumi tutorials (SOBO, Batch Fully Bayesian), and references to related Ax repository issues. Template for collecting 100 problem statements across different personas in physical sciences.
- **RAG experiment infrastructure**: Created `data/raw/rag_assistant_runs.yaml` for tracking RAG assistant experiments with experiment IDs, prompts, results, and log correlations. Added `scripts/run_rag_experiments.py` to run experiments programmatically and capture intermediate grid selections, generated scripts, and terminal logs. Added `scripts/run_experiments_and_upload.sh` bash wrapper. Added `data/raw/README_RAG_EXPERIMENTS.md` documenting experiment structure and artifact locations. Updated to work with GitHub Actions environment secrets.

### Changed
- **ProblemStructure schema**: Now follows exact solution format with `search_space` (list of parameters), `objective` (list of objectives), `budget`, `batch_size`, `noise_model`, `constraints`, `historical_data_points`, and `model_preference` - matching test problem structure.
- **Constraint distinction**: Clear separation between `composition_constraint` (fractions sum to 1.0 for materials) and `sum_constraint` (general sum constraints) with explicit total value tracking via `total` field instead of `target_value`.
- **Parameter types**: Simplified to `continuous` and `categorical` (removed `integer`) to match solution format expectations.
- **ParameterExtractor prompt**: Includes formatted table showing grid selection logic with pre-computed boolean flags for each constraint type based on extracted structure, making the mapping explicit and deterministic.
- **Parameter selector workflow**: Two-stage extraction (structure → grid) with solution-format intermediate representation instead of direct natural language → grid mapping.
### Fixed
- Removed API key existence checks from experiment runner scripts - secrets are available in GitHub Actions runtime but not in Copilot agent sandbox.

## [0.1.7] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Settings reload method**: Added `settings.reload_from_env()` method to allow reloading configuration from environment variables after module import. Fixes Colab/Jupyter notebook issue where settings were cached before environment variables were set.

### Changed
- **Colab tutorial improvements**: Updated Step 5 to explicitly call `settings.reload_from_env()` and print confirmation of vector store path. Ensures vector store is properly detected in notebooks.
- **Build script error message**: Updated orchestrator error message to use `python -m honegumi_rag_assistant.build_vector_store` instead of outdated `scripts/build_vector_store.py` path.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Vector store Ax version pinning**: `src/honegumi_rag_assistant/build_vector_store.py` now defaults to cloning Ax v0.4.3 (matching honegumi dependency) instead of latest main branch. This prevents documentation version mismatch where LLM receives v1.x docs but generates v0.4.3 code. New `--ax-version` parameter allows specifying different versions when needed. Addresses issue raised in PR #3.
- Vector store missing condition now properly detected when path is configured but directory doesn't exist

### Changed
- **Build script location**: Moved `build_vector_store.py` from `scripts/` to `src/honegumi_rag_assistant/` to make it available as a module for pip-installed users. Usage: `python -m honegumi_rag_assistant.build_vector_store`
- **Retrieval UX improvements**: Simplified retrieval output to show only essential information. In non-debug mode, displays "Planning X parallel retrievals..." followed by success message with context count and timing, or clear error if vector store missing. Removes verbose query details and individual retriever timings from default output.
- **Vector store metadata**: Build script now saves `metadata.json` with build details including Ax version, build date, chunk configuration, and document counts for better provenance tracking.
- Removed verbose per-query retrieval details from non-debug output
- Cleaner success message: "✓ Retrieved X contexts in Y.XXs"

### Added
- Clear warning when vector store is not found: prompts user to build it
- Vector store path existence check before attempting retrieval

## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-20

### Changed
- Simplified ReadTheDocs navigation structure (removed unnecessary sections)

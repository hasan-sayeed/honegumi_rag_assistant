      I need to find the best temperature and time for sintering ceramic samples to get maximum density. 
      I can run about 20-30 experiments.

    prompt: |
      I want to optimize sintering conditions for ceramic samples to maximize density (g/cm³). 
      The temperature can range from 800 to 1200°C, and sintering time from 1 to 6 hours. 
      I have budget for about 20-30 experiments. The measurements will have some noise since 
      density measurements can vary a bit between samples.

      I need to optimize two continuous parameters (temperature: 800-1200°C, time: 1-6 hours) 
      to maximize density (g/cm³) of ceramic samples. This is a single-objective optimization 
      with noisy measurements. I have a budget of about 25 experiments.

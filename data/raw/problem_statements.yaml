        I want to optimize sintering conditions for ceramic samples to maximize density (g/cm³). 
        The temperature can range from 800 to 1200°C, and sintering time from 1 to 6 hours. 
        I have budget for about 20-30 experiments. The measurements will have some noise since 
        density measurements can vary a bit between samples.

        I'm working on developing an anti-corrosion coating formulation and need to optimize 
        the composition. I have five components to work with: resin, inhibitor, insulator, 
        stabilizer, and I also need to control the coating thickness. I can test about 6 
        samples at a time in parallel. I know there are some constraints on the composition 
        like the resin fraction should be higher than inhibitor and insulator, and the 
        fractions need to sum to 1. Looking for the formulation that minimizes corrosion damage.

        fraction (0-0.1), and coating thickness (0.1-10 mm). The fractions must sum to 1,

        Need to optimize a polymer formulation for a client. They want high strength

        some historical data from literature (3 data points) that could help bootstrap 
        the model. This is clearly a multi-objective problem with a threshold constraint 
        on strength. What's the best way to set this up in Ax?

        I'm investigating anti-corrosion coating formulations as part of my research program. 
        The system involves four compositional variables (resin, inhibitor, insulator, stabilizer) 
        plus coating thickness. The composition components must sum to unity, and I hypothesize 
        that the resin fraction should exceed both inhibitor and insulator fractions based on 
        the literature. I have access to parallel testing equipment allowing 6 concurrent 
        experiments. The objective is to minimize corrosion damage.

        I'm studying anti-corrosion coating optimization with 5 parameters: resin fraction (0-1), 
        inhibitor fraction (0-1), insulator fraction (0-1), stabilizer fraction (0-0.1), and 
        coating thickness (0.1-10 mm). The fractions must sum to 1. Based on theoretical 
        considerations, resin should be greater than both inhibitor and insulator. I can run 
        batches of 6 samples in parallel, planning 15-20 batches. The goal is to minimize 
        corrosion damage score. I'd like to use a robust Bayesian model given the measurement 
        uncertainty.

        Our R&D team needs to develop a new polymer for a client. They want good strength

        I'm conducting research on biodegradable polymers and need to perform multi-objective 
        optimization. The objectives are mechanical strength and biodegradability rate. The 
        formulation space consists of five monomer fractions subject to a simplex constraint, 
        plus two process parameters: extrusion rate and temperature. I have three literature 
        data points that I intend to incorporate as priors. There is a minimum strength

        I need to find the best temperature and time for sintering ceramic samples to get maximum density. 
        I can run about 20-30 experiments.
      notes: |
        Typical underspecified request from a materials scientist.
        Missing: parameter bounds, units, noise expectations, parameter types.
        User assumes the assistant will ask for missing details.

      description: |
        I want to optimize sintering conditions for ceramic samples to maximize density (g/cm³). 
        The temperature can range from 800 to 1200°C, and sintering time from 1 to 6 hours. 
        I have budget for about 20-30 experiments. The measurements will have some noise since 
        density measurements can vary a bit between samples.
      notes: |
        More conversational, includes key details but maintains natural chat style.
        Provides bounds, mentions noise informally, specifies budget and units.

      notes: |
        Based on Honegumi interactive grid options (https://honegumi.readthedocs.io/).
        Single-objective optimization with default GP model.
        Single-task (not multi-task), no categorical parameters.
        No constraints (sum, order, linear, or composition).
        Two continuous parameters with noisy observations handled by default noise model.

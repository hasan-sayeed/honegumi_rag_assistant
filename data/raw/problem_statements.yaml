        I need to find the best temperature and time for sintering ceramic samples.
        Temperature can be between 800 and 1200 degrees Celsius.
        Time can be between 1 and 6 hours.
        I want to maximize density. I can measure around 20-30 samples.
      notes: |
        Typical request from a materials scientist without optimization background.
        Uses natural language, doesn't mention specific BO concepts.
        Reasonable constraints but doesn't specify units clearly or optimization strategy.

        Optimize sintering temperature (800-1200°C) and sintering time (1-6 hours) 
        to maximize ceramic sample density (g/cm³). 
        
        Search space:
        - Temperature: continuous, 800-1200°C
        - Time: continuous, 1-6 hours
        
        Objective: Maximize density (single objective)
        Budget: 20-30 experiments
        Expected noise: Medium (experimental measurements)
      notes: |
        Expert-refined version with:
        - Clear objective function (maximize density)
        - Explicit parameter ranges with units
        - Variable types specified (continuous)
        - Budget constraint stated
        - Noise level indicated
        - Single-objective optimization identified
